# top-albums

The idea behind this project was to scrape all of the Data from a webpage and then to load into a csv file. I scraped all of the Data 
from a website that featured the Top 50 albums of all times.

Here is the website: https://www.businessinsider.com/50-best-selling-albums-all-time-2016-9#21-led-zeppelin-physical-graffiti-30

I took the album, its rank, its artist, and the number of units that were sold
and I stored that all into a Pandas DataFrame. I scraped the Data that I needed using BeautifulSoup, a Python library. 

Once I had all of the Data that I needed in a Pandas DataFrame, I converted into a csv file.
